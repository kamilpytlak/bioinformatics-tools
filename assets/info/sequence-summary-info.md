## Sequence Summary Tool

This tool provides nucleotide/amino acid sequence analysis within:
* length and distribution of sequence (both tabular and graphical form);
* GC pair contents (in %);
* using chi-square test to check whether the nucleotide/amino acid distribution is uniform within a sequence;

To use it, simply upload a sequence saved in FASTA format and select the desired sequence(s). Analysis will be performed
for each selected sequence (in order of selection).
