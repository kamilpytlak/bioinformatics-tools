# BioT - Bioinformatics Tools

*BioT* is an application that provides various common bioinformatics tools: one- and two-dimensional sequence analysis,
as well as the sequence alignment. *BioT* mostly uses the functionality of the *BioPython* module, using a user-friendly
approach in terms of usage.

Version 1.0 (May 27, 2022) includes the following functionality:
- summary of nucleotide/amino acid sequences stored as a FASTA file. This includes calculation of basic statistics and chi-square test;
- comparison of two nucleotide sequences using dotplot.

To take advantage of the functionality, upload your own sequence using the tool available on the sidebar.
The entered sequence will be checked for correctness. If the validation is successful, it will be stored in memory until the session ends or a new sequence is uploaded/selected.
You can also use sample sequences by selecting a particular one from the drop-down tool.
